# 2.5.0 - 2016-03-14

- Added: cssnext will now warn you when you have duplicates plugins.
  This is a really common mistake, people include plugins that are already
  included in cssnext and maybe sometimes in an inaccurate position.  
  **Most tutorial on the internet are wrong (probably 99%)
  and show provide duplicates in their examples.
  (eg: autoprefixer + cssnext - but cssnext already includes autoprefixer).**  
  _In order to fix this, here is a warning. You are welcome._
  [Read more about this issue](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/issues/764)
- Added: ``rem`` will now adjust its behavior according to browser option

---

**pre 2.0.0 information was related to `cssnext` package.**

---

# 1.8.4 - 2015-08-24

- Fixed: `compress` option now works again correctly. A recent update in cssnano
has introduced some minor breaking changes the way cssnext changed plugins
metadata (`pluginName`).
A direct minor change is that `messages` (in console or in css output) now show
real origin (postcss plugin name) instead of a vague "cssnext" origin.
([#195](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/195))

# 1.8.3 - 2015-08-06

- Fixed: replacement of `postcss-log-warnings` (deprecated) by
`postcss-reporter`

- Fixed: CLI now add `to` option automatically
([#159](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/159))
If you were happy with the previous CLI behavior (which was not rebasing url),
you should probably just add the `--no-url` to keep the CSS as it was.

([#166](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/166))
- Added: CLI output file dirname is now automatically created (using `mkdirp`)

- Fixed: bullet for browser messages should be visible on Chrome Windows.
Changed from `〉` to `›`

# 1.7.0 - 2015-06-17

Previously they were working with **and without** pseudo syntax ':'
[which is incorrect according to specs](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-selectors/issues/5#issuecomment-90774654)
Now you must use `@custom-selector :--{name}` syntax instead of
`@custom-selector --{name}`

next major release

([#131](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/131))

# 1.5.1 - 2015-05-25

replacement of colors lib by chalk in 1.5.0
([#129](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/pull/129))

# 1.5.0 - 2015-05-23

# 0.4.1 - 2014-11-01

- Added: gray() support
([#44](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/44))

# 0.4.0 - 2014-10-23

- Changed: color feature has been exploded to multiples features
([#40](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/40)).

Before

```js
var output = cssnext(input, {
  features: {
    // providing `true` (or omitting this value) instead of the following object
    //  was the default behavior
    color: {
      color: true
      hexAlpha: true
      hwb: true
      rebeccapurple: true
    }
  }
})
```

Now

```js
var output = cssnext(input, {
  // as usual if you where using all features, you can just omit this values
  features: {
    colorFunction: true,
    colorHexAlpha: true,
    colorHwb: true,
    colorRebeccapurple: true
    }
  }
})
```

- Changed: cssnext options are not passed to all plugins anymore. You know need
to specify feature options by passing object to `features` properties  
([#39](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext/issues/39)).

Before

```js
//eg: preserve custom properties
var output = cssnext(input, {
  preserve: true
})
```

Now

```js
//eg: preserve custom properties
var output = cssnext(input, {
  features: {
    customProperties: {
      preserve: true
    }
  }
})
```

- Added: more control on sourcemap is possible using the new `map` option
(direct postcss option).
Using this option make `sourcemap` one to be ignored and change the return value
 of `cssnext()` (object instead of string)

This change have been made to avoid collision between options
(of each features).
