WeChat is similar to [Twitter](https://twitter.com). Almost everyone has an account on WeChat in China.

The Jenkins WeChat subscription account delivers messages or events from the Jenkins Community.

All articles should be open-source, every contributor could create a PR. Once we reviewed it, your articles could be released.

We have a [chatbot](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/wechat-backend) that can reply to your messages automatically. 
Unfortunately, its ability is very limited; it only understands a few keywords from [here](management/auto-reply/keywords-welcome.yml).

# TODO List

Feel free to pick up a task from [here](https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-zh/projects/2). If you're interested in contributing to this project, please read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
